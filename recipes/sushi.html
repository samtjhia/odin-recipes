    <p>To make sushi at home, begin by preparing sushi rice: rinse 2 cups of short-grain rice until the water runs clear, then cook it with 2 cups of water. Once cooked, mix in a seasoning made from ¼ cup rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt—gently fold this into the rice and let it cool to room temperature. While the rice cools, prepare your fillings: popular choices include thin slices of raw or cooked fish (like salmon or crab), julienned cucumber, avocado, or pickled radish. Lay a sheet of nori (seaweed) on a bamboo sushi mat, spread a thin, even layer of rice over it, leaving about an inch of nori bare at the top edge.</p>
    <p>Place your desired fillings in a line across the center of the rice. Using the mat, roll the sushi tightly from the bottom, pressing gently to form a firm roll, then seal the edge with a little water. Slice the roll into bite-sized pieces with a sharp, wet knife. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side. You can also try variations like inside-out rolls (with rice on the outside), nigiri (hand-pressed rice topped with fish), or vegetarian versions using tofu and vegetables. Sushi is versatile, so feel free to get creative with flavors and textures.</p>
