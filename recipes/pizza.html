    <p>To make a classic pizza at home, start with the dough: mix 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) of instant yeast in a bowl. Gradually add about ¾ cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</p>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the base, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top, and add your favorite toppings such as pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, or olives. Drizzle a little olive oil over the top and season with salt, pepper, and dried oregano or basil.</p>
    <p>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice it into wedges. Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes if desired. Enjoy your homemade pizza with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal!</p>
