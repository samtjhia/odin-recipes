    <p>To make a classic burger at home, start with the patties: mix 1 pound of ground beef (80% lean) with 1 teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of black pepper, and any additional seasonings you like (such as garlic powder or onion powder). Form the mixture into 4 equal patties, making a slight indentation in the center of each to prevent them from puffing up while cooking. Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. If you like cheese, add a slice of your favorite cheese (like cheddar or American) on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to let it melt.</p>
    <p>While the patties are cooking, prepare your burger buns by toasting them lightly on the grill or in a toaster. Assemble your burgers by placing a cooked patty on the bottom half of each bun. Top with your favorite condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or barbecue sauce. Add fresh toppings like lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, and sliced onions. You can also include extras like crispy bacon or avocado slices for added flavor. Place the top half of the bun on each burger and serve immediately with a side of fries or a salad. Enjoy your homemade burgers with friends and family!</p>
